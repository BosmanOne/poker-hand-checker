# poker-hand-checker
Check for highest poker hand in selected cards.

Objective

Create a program designed to check poker hands from picked cards using css and javascript.

Details

Main design assumptions are as follow: program uses standard 52-card deck with no wild cards, except under ace-to-five low rules where straights, flushes and straight flushes are not recognized. There are 9 hand categories, starting from the lowest rank: High card, One pair, Two pair, Three of a kind, Straight, Flush, Full house, Four of a kind, Straight flush (and royal flush). Program is checking for hands from lowest to highest, mainly because higher hands firstly require to check for lower ones (e.g. Full house require one pair and one three of kind). Program displays on the screen list of 3 highest possible hands. It is possible to highlight these cards by hovering the name on the list. Design is fully responsible and mobile-friendly.
